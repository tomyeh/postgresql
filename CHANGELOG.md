### Version 1.0.0-beta

* Migrate to null safety
* Numeric and Decimal types are consider as `double`, instead of `BigInt`.
    * It means the precision is bounded by `double`.
* The `getConnectionName()` and `getDebugName()` arguments are simplifed as `String? connectionName` and `String? debugName`.
* `Settings.fromMap` and `Settings.toMap` are removed.
* The `mockSocketConnect` argument is removed.

### Version 0.7.7

* Rename `freeConnections` to `limitConnections`
* Add `limitTimeout` to control how long to wait when exceeding `limitConnections`

### Version 0.7.6

* If `freeConnections` is set, we'll wait up to 700ms, if number of connections exceeds [freeConnections].
It helps to reduce number of connections if there are a lot of short-lived connections.

### Version 0.7.4

* `Settings.onMaxConnection` introduced to monitor the usage of DB connections.

### Version 0.7.3

* `freeConnections` introduced to control maximal number of connections kept in a pool.

### Version 0.7.0

* **Breaking**: the substition with a Map instance won't treat number identifiers specially. For example, if `@0` is specified, it will consider the identifier as `'0'` and retrieve `values['0']`.

### Version 0.6.0

* Array type with single dimension supported.
* `isUtcTimeZone` removed from `DefaultTypeConverter.decodeDateTime()` and related functions.
* `DefaultTypeConverter.decodeDateTime()` converts the DateTime instance to local time by calling `DateTime.toLocal()`.

### Version 0.5.8

* `encodeString()` ignores the `trimNull` argument. Now it always removes the null characters.

### Version 0.5.7

* `Pool.busyConnectionCount` counts only `inUse`.

### Version 0.5.6

* `Connect.runInTransaction` returns the result of the transaction operation.

### Version 0.5.5

* `Pool.debugName` removed.
* Make the pool more likely to *shrink*.

### Version 0.5.4

* `PoolImpl` with two new methods: `pooledConnectionCount` and `busyConnectionCount`

### Version 0.5.3

* Support BigInt.
    * Note: `_PG_NUMERIC` will be converted to `BigInt`, if possible (instead of `String`). Otherwise, it is converted to a `String` instance.

### Version 0.5.2

* Upgrade to Dart 2.5

### Version 0.3.4
 
* Update broken crypto dependency.

#### Version 0.3.3

* Permit connection without a password. Thanks to Jirka Daněk.

#### Version 0.3.2

* Improve handing of datetimes. Thanks to Joe Conway.
* Remove manually cps transformed async code.
* Fix #58: Establish connections concurrently. Thanks to Tom Yeh.

* Fix #69: Empty connection pool not establishing connections.

#### Version 0.3.1+1

* Expose column information via row.getColumns(). Credit to Jesper Håkansson for this change.

#### Version 0.3.0

* A new connection pool with more configuration options.
* Support for json and timestamptz types.
* Utc time zone support.
* User customisable type conversions.
* Improved error handling.
* Connection.onClosed has been removed.
* Some api has been renamed, the original names are still functional but marked as deprecated.
    * import 'package:postgresql/postgresql_pool.dart'  =>  import 'package:postgresql/pool.dart'
    * Pool.destroy() => Pool.stop()
    * The constants were upper case and int type. Now typed and lower camel case to match the style guide.
    * Connection.unhandled => Connection.messages
    * Connection.transactionStatus => Connection.transactionState

  Thanks to Tom Yeh and Petar Sabev for their helpful feedback.
